#+TITLE: Deriving temperatures from line widths using MUSE spectra
#+AUTHOR: William Henney
#+EMAIL: will@henney.org


* Plan
It looks like the sigmas that I measured from MUSE are good enough to find kinematic temperatures.  I want to break this out from the main MUSE project, so that it doesn't get dragged down by the general inertia


* Marshalling the image files
+ We need the mean, sigma, and linesum for all the lines of interest
+ Note that the whole =data/= folder is omitted from the git repo, because it is too large (0.5 GB at the start)

* Comments on individual line sets

** H alpha and [N II]
+ We have both the 6583 and 6548 lines
  + 6583 is slightly broader
  + Probably because of C II blend
** H beta and [O III]
+ The instrumental width is a bit larger here
+ But it seems very stable
+ We have the two [O III] lines so we can interpolate to H beta
** H alpha and He I 6678
+ This might be the ideal combination
+ The overlap in the emission zones is much higher than with [N II] or [O III]
  + And the T-dependence of the emissivity is very similar
  + Need to check Ne dependence
  + We could check this by doing correlations in surface brightness and looking at velocity difference
+ It is a singlet, so there is no fine-structure broadening
+ The difference in atomic weights is a little bit less
  + H \to He : 1 - 1/4 = 0.75
  + H \to O : 1 - 1/16 = 0.9375
  + But that is hardly significant
+ Also s/n is a bit lower since it is a weaker line
  + But a little binning would fix that
** H beta and He I 5876
+ This is not so good since He line is triplet
+ But it will be a good independent test

** Redder lines
+ We have H I 9229
  + Intrumental linewidth is a bit better
  + But only strong option for comparison is [S III] 9069
  + Which would need correcting for both [S II] /and/ [S IV]
  + But we could also use H I 9015 to interpolate to 9069 position
+ Then there is the [Ar III] 7137, 7751
  + Which could maybe be compared with H I 8438, etc
  + But it isn't really until we get to H I 8750 that the data quality is any good
  + And that is a a long way from [Ar III]
